I like that you can dial in the combination, tape it on the last number setting and just use the key to open and close it.  This is great for folks that are using it as fire protection.  This is very heavy.....over 110 lbs so its not something your average thief can just pick up and dash off with.  If you're not planning to bolt it to the floor, it would be nice if customer service advised you to fill the bolt hole in with fireproof caulking or supply a small squeeze tube with it because if it's not filled, the safe is no longer fireproof.  It's quite roomy inside and can fit your valuables easily.  The shelf is removable and there is a tray as well.A good idea for your own protection is photograph your electronics, furniture and put a list of serial numbers on a CD to be stored in there in case you do have a fire.  Your insurance company cannot then deny replacement of those items and sub cheaper replacements.After a while you will get moisture if you don't get an absorber in there.  I suggest you get a cordless dehumidifier here on Amazon that will last and last and forget about having to open it every week or so.I highly recommend this product and this company."

If I was protecting from burglary I would probably research a different product, but I was really looking for fire protection for important documents.Don't forget to place documents and other items in a plastic Ziplok type bag prior to storage/ I don't think this is emphasized enough. The safe pulls in environmental moisture to do its job - this means moisture and, potentially, mold on your paper documents. Probably a dessicant would be advisable as well.

But now that it's in place I could not be happier. I built a base for it out of two pieces 1\" of plywood glued together 22\" wide and 32\" deep with 12\" in front to keep the safe from tipping. I used 2\" x 1/2\" lag bolts to bolt it to the base.One thing to know: the door on mine does not seem to be easily removable. You cannot simply lift it from the bottom off the pins like some other reviewers have noted. I wish it was easily removed as the door weighs a mini-ton and it would have been much easier to get in the house with it detached."

Plan on mounting it to studs or the floor, either can be done. Or do like I did and place wedges under the bottom in front to keep it from falling. It comes with skids fastened to the bottom to give it more stability during shipping. These can be left on or removed. I removed them and got a little cut up from rough edges or burrs around the drill holes, so be aware of that.  It's easy to reprogram the electronic lock with a new code. It comes with a factory set code. There is a reset button inside the door that is easy to find. Press it and enter the new code and you're good to go. You can have two different codes, though I don't see the need for having more than one. There are cushioned rests for long guns, and adjustable shelves for handguns and whatever else. It comes with a box of dessicant, which is useful for prevention of mold or rust issues. All in all a good find and a good buy. I would recommend this safe."

            "review": "Finish is very good as is the interior, however, this is not a 16 gun safe, but an 8 gun at best. It is very shallow and the exterior hinge caps will easily fall off. It has 1/2\" four holes in the back, one presumably for a powered humidity control at the bottom left, and 3 holes horizontally mid-height for wall anchorage. Be very careful removing the 2x4s and metal shipping frame from the safe at the bottom. At 308lbs it will hurt the careless. You need help to maneuver it. Disappointed that it's marked in back as Made in China, but for an interim safe w/45min fire protection and both a digital and mechanical key lock it should work."

We are using it for rifles, hand guns, ammunition and documents. Very well made, very heavy, easy to bolt down. Packed extremely well for shipping, not a blemish on it. Delivery was easy and timely. Would recommend to anyone."
